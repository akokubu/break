## differences between the way transactions are created in the Hello World example vs the Break example.

I think the biggest difference is that it is sent via server using connection.sendRawTransaction.
Sending a signed transaction would also be different

## accounts

The following accounts are available
* programAccount: owner of program
* programDataAccount: account for storing data
* feeAcount: account for payment of settlement fees
